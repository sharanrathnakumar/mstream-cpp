Project: Distributed Media Streaming Server in C++
--------------------------------------------------
This project involves building a distributed media streaming server in C++ that leverages IPC, multi-threading, multimedia, and networking concepts. 

Concept:
-------
Develop a server application that streams multimedia content (e.g., audio/video) to multiple clients.
Utilize multithreading to manage concurrent client connections and streaming requests.
Implement IPC mechanisms (e.g., sockets, pipes) to enable communication between server and clients.
Employ multimedia libraries (e.g., FFmpeg, gstreamer) for decoding and encoding media data.
Integrate networking concepts like TCP/UDP protocols for efficient data transfer.

Functionality:
-------------
The server should accept client connections and receive requests for specific media files.
The server should use multithreading to handle multiple client requests simultaneously.
Depending on the request, the server should:
Decode the requested media file using multimedia libraries.
Create a streaming session for the client.
Stream the encoded media data to the client using the selected network protocol.
Clients should be able to:
Connect to the server and request media files.
Receive and play streamed media data.

Technology Stack:
----------------
Programming Language: C++
Multithreading Library: C++ Standard Thread Library or Boost Thread library
IPC Mechanisms: Sockets (TCP/UDP), Pipes
Multimedia Library: FFmpeg
Networking Libraries: Boost.asio, Qt Network

Additional Features:
-------------------
Implement user authentication and authorization for access control.
Add support for different media formats (audio/video).
Allow clients to pause, resume, and seek within the media stream.
Implement load balancing mechanisms to distribute client requests across multiple servers.
Monitor server performance and resource utilization.
